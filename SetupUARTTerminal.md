# Setup UART Terminal

Currently our only way to control the console is by providing it commands in the `/etc/init.d/S50ui` file. What would be really nice is to have an interactive terminal on the console so that we can send commands to the console from a separate device. This will also make debugging issues waaayyyy easier.
